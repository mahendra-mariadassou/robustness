\begin{abstract}
Inferring evolutionary histories (phylogenetic trees) has important applications but it is rare to observe a single evolutionary history unanimously implied by all genetic loci, and different genetic sites may conflict with respect to the implied phylogeny.  However, phylogenetic trees are complex mathematical objects that allows the study of the variability and bias of the estimates. In this paper we review the source of errors, how to construct consensus trees, outliers detection either at loci or species level as well as the definition on continuous distances on a tree space.
