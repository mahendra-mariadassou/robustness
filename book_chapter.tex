\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Reconstructing phylogenies has become a common task in comparative biology. It is however difficult to construct fully reliable phylogenies: trees estimated from different loci may differ and different genetic characters may support different phylogenies. Validation and robustness assessment are therefore critical. Here, we review sources of errors and uncertainties and introduce support values used to characterize weak and strong parts of the tree. We also show to construct robust consensus trees from a robust and how to detect outliers at either the loci or species level. Finally, we show how continuous distances on a tree space can be used to frame validation in a statistical setting.
