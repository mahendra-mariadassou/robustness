\section{Sources of Error} \label{sec:error-sources}

We do not address the species tree/gene tree discrepancy. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Sampling errors
 \item Modeling errors
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sampling Errors} \label{sec:sampling-error}
Noisy data (imperfect alignments, sequencing error, one individual per species, different parts of the gene/genome can have different evolutionary histories). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Limited Amount of Informations} \label{sec:small-n}
Noisy data (imperfect alignments, sequencing error, one individual per species, different parts of the gene/genome can have different evolutionary histories). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Modeling Errors} \label{sec:modeling-errors}
Site independence

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Model Misspecification} \label{sec:misspecification}
Use of oversimplified models (Rokas et al). 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Complex Evolutionary History} \label{sec:complex-history}

% Incomplete Lineage Sorting (in a multi tree Context)
