  Abstract                 = {We revisit statistical tests for branches of evolutionary trees reconstructed upon molecular data. A new, fast, approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) for branches is presented here as a competitive alternative to nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian estimation of branch support. The aLRT is based on the idea of the conventional LRT, with the null hypothesis corresponding to the assumption that the inferred branch has length 0. We show that the LRT statistic is asymptotically distributed as a maximum of three random variables drawn from the chi(0)2 + chi(1)2 distribution. The new aLRT of interior branch uses this distribution for significance testing, but the test statistic is approximated in a slightly conservative but practical way as 2(l1- l2), i.e., double the difference between the maximum log-likelihood values corresponding to the best tree and the second best topological arrangement around the branch of interest. Such a test is fast because the log-likelihood value l2 is computed by optimizing only over the branch of interest and the four adjacent branches, whereas other parameters are fixed at their optimal values corresponding to the best ML tree. The performance of the new test was studied on simulated 4-, 12-, and 100-taxon data sets with sequences of different lengths. The aLRT is shown to be accurate, powerful, and robust to certain violations of model assumptions. The aLRT is implemented within the algorithm used by the recent fast maximum likelihood tree estimation program PHYML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003).},
  Comment                  = {Very nice paper about aLRT. LRT for branches tests all alternatives topologies (around a branch) against a null hypothesis (the branch has length 0) and looks at 2(l1 - l0) (twice the max difference of the three resolutions of the central branch). aLRT replaces l1-l0 by l1 - l2 (difference between best and second best) and so cannot be statistically significant for all three topologies against the null topology. aLRT has accurate power and resistance to model misspecification (as long as at least HKY+G is used). Better than bootstrap and PP in terms of level and power but no so good for probability of inferred tree to be correct against cut-off probabilty (as opposed to PP which are nearly perfect in the absence of model violation).},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic inference and evaluating support for inferred relationships is at the core of many studies testing evolutionary hypotheses. Despite the popularity of nonparametric bootstrap frequencies and Bayesian posterior probabilities, the interpretation of these measures of tree branch support remains a source of discussion. Furthermore, both methods are computationally expensive and become prohibitive for large data sets. Recent fast approximate likelihood-based measures of branch supports (approximate likelihood ratio test [aLRT] and Shimodaira-Hasegawa [SH]-aLRT) provide a compelling alternative to these slower conventional methods, offering not only speed advantages but also excellent levels of accuracy and power. Here we propose an additional method: a Bayesian-like transformation of aLRT (aBayes). Considering both probabilistic and frequentist frameworks, we compare the performance of the three fast likelihood-based methods with the standard bootstrap (SBS), the Bayesian approach, and the recently introduced rapid bootstrap. Our simulations and real data analyses show that with moderate model violations, all tests are sufficiently accurate, but aLRT and aBayes offer the highest statistical power and are very fast. With severe model violations aLRT, aBayes and Bayesian posteriors can produce elevated false-positive rates. With data sets for which such violation can be detected, we recommend using SH-aLRT, the nonparametric version of aLRT based on a procedure similar to the Shimodaira-Hasegawa tree selection. In general, the SBS seems to be excessively conservative and is much slower than our approximate likelihood-based methods.},
  Comment                  = {Survey of different branch support show that SH-aLRT, Standard Bootstrap (SBS), Rapid Bootstrap (RBS) are conservative and robust (wrt to model misspecification) method whereas aBayes and PP are more powerful (do not underestimate true branch support). None of the branch support has a probabilistic interpretation (except PP when both the model and the priors are correct). With moderate model violations, all methods are sufficlently powerful and accurate (with better power for aLRT and aBayes). With severe model violations, aBayes, PP and aLRT produce high rates of False Positive (strongly supported incorrect branches). In such case, SH-aLRT is recommended. In all cases, SBS is slow and overly conservative.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the computation of the influence function, a tool to measure the impact of each piece of sampled data on the statistical inference of a parameter, we propose to analyze the support of the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree for each site. We provide a new tool for filtering data sets (nucleotides, amino acids, and others) in the context of ML phylogenetic reconstructions. Because different sites support different phylogenic topologies in different ways, outlier sites, that is, sites with a very negative influence value, are important: they can drastically change the topology resulting from the statistical inference. Therefore, these outlier sites must be clearly identified and their effects accounted for before drawing biological conclusions from the inferred tree. A matrix containing 158 fungal terminals all belonging to Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, and Glomeromycota is analyzed. We show that removing the strongest outlier from the analysis strikingly modifies the ML topology, with a loss of as many as 20\% of the internal nodes. As a result, estimating the topology on the filtered data set results in a topology with enhanced bootstrap support. From this analysis, the polyphyletic status of the fungal phyla Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota is reinforced, suggesting the necessity of revisiting the systematics of these fungal groups. We show the ability of influence function to produce new evolution hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {Three desirable properties for any method of selecting a subset of evolutionary units (EUs) for conservation or for genomic sequencing are discussed. These properties are spread, stability, and applicability. We are motivated by a practical case in which the maximization of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which has been suggested as a suitable method, appears to lead to counterintuitive collections of EUs and does not meet these three criteria. We define a simple greedy algorithm (GREEDYMMD) as a close approximation to choosing the subset that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance (MMD) between EUs. GREEDYMMD satisfies our three criteria and may be a useful alternative to PD in real-world situations. In particular, we show that this method of selection is suitable under a model of biodiversity in which features arise and/or disappear during evolution. We also show that if distances between EUs satisfy the ultrametric condition, then GREEDYMMD delivers an optimal subset of EUs that maximizes both the minimum pairwise distance and the PD. Finally, because GREEDYMMD works with distances and does not require a tree, it is readily applicable to many data sets.},

Changing the number of taxa in single-locus analyses had limited effects on log likelihood differences between the gnepine (Gnetales plus Pinaceae) and gnetifer (Gnetales plus conifers) trees. Distinguishing among these trees also was little affected by the use of different substitution parameters. The 13-locus combined data set was partitioned into nine classes based on substitution rates. Sites evolving at intermediate rates had the best likelihood and parsimony scores on gnepine trees, and those evolving at the fastest rates had the best parsimony scores on Gnetales-sister trees (Gnetales plus other seed plants). When the fastest evolving sites were excluded from parsimony analyses, well-supported gnepine trees were inferred from the combined data and from each genomic partition. When all sites were included, Gnetales-sister trees were inferred from the combined data, whereas a different tree was inferred from each genomic partition. Maximum likelihood trees from the combined data and from each genomic partition were well-supported gnepine trees. A preliminary stratigraphic test highlights the poor fit of Gnetales-sister trees to the fossil data.},

Felsenstein's method, which in concept is a straightforward application of the bootstrap, is widely used, but has been criticized as biased in the genetics literature. This paper concerns the use of the bootstrap in the tree problem. We show that Felsenstein's method is not biased, but that it can be corrected to better agree with standard ideas of confidence levels and hypothesis testing. These corrections can be made by using the more elaborate bootstrap method presented here, at the expense of considerably more computation.},

Statistical, computational, and algorithmic work on them has been ongoing for four decades, with great advances in understanding. Yet no book has summarized this work until now. Inferring Phylogenies explains clearly the assumptions and logic of making inferences about phylogenies, and using them to make inferences about evolutionary processes. It is an essential text and reference for anyone who wants to understand how phylogenies are reconstructed and how they are used. <P>As phylogenies are inferred with various kinds of data, this book concentrates on some of the central ones: discretely coded characters, molecular sequences, gene frequencies, and quantitative traits. Also covered are restriction sites, RAPDs, and microsatellites. <P>Inferring Phylogenies is intended for graduate-level courses, assuming some knowledge of statistics, mathematics (calculus and fundamental matrix algebra), molecular sequences, and quantitative genetics.}},

  Abstract                 = {The recently-developed statistical method known as the "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

In all cases the conditions for this failure (which is the failure to be statistically consistent) are essentially that parallel changes exceed informative, nonparallel changes. It is possible for these methods to be inconsistent even when change is improbable a priori, provided that evolutionary rates in different lineages are sufficiently unequal.

  Abstract                 = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms.

  Abstract                 = {Bootstrapping is a common method for assessing confidence in phylogenetic analyses. Although bootstrapping was first applied in phylogenetics to assess the repeatability of a given result, bootstrap results are commonly interpreted as a measure of the probability that a phylogenetic estimate represents the true phylogeny. Here we use computer simulations and a laboratory-generated phylogeny to test bootstrapping results of parsimony analyses, both as measures of repeatability (i.e., the probability of repeating a result given a new sample of characters) and accuracy (i.e., the probability that a result represents the true phylogeny). Our results indicate that any given bootstrap proportion provides an unbiased but highly imprecise measure of repeatability, unless the actual probability of replicating the relevant result is nearly one. The imprecision of the estimate is great enough to render the estimate virtually useless as a measure of repeatability. Under conditions thought to be typical of most phylogenetic analyses, however, bootstrap proportions in majority-rule consensus trees provide biased but highly conservative estimates of the probability of correctly inferring the corresponding clades. Specifically, under conditions of equal rates of change, symmetric phylogenies, and internodal change of $\leq$20% of the characters, bootstrap proportions of $\geq$70% usually correspond to a probability of $\geq$95% that the corresponding clade is real. However, under conditions of very high rates of internodal change (approaching randomization of the characters among taxa) or highly unequal rates of change among taxa, bootstrap proportions >50% are overestimates of accuracy.},

As expected, corrected parsimony was consistent. For these data, maximum likelihood with the clock assumption outperformed each of the other methods tested. The distance-based methods performed marginally better than did maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood without the clock assumption. Data correction was generally detrimental to accuracy, especially for short sequence lengths. We identified another region of the parameter space where, although consistent for a given method, some incorrect trees were each selected with up to twice the frequency of the correct (generating) tree for sequences of bounded length. These incorrect trees are those where the outgroup has been incorrectly placed. In addition to this problem, the placement of the outgroup sequence can have a confounding effect on the ingroup tree, whereby the ingroup is correct when using the ingroup sequences alone, but with the inclusion of the outgroup the ingroup tree becomes incorrect.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenomics refers to the inference of historical relationships among species using genome-scale sequence data and to the use of phylogenetic analysis to infer protein function in multigene families. With rapidly decreasing sequencing costs, phylogenomics is becoming synonymous with evolutionary analysis of genome-scale and taxonomically densely sampled data sets. In phylogenetic inference applications, this translates into very large data sets that yield evolutionary and functional inferences with extremely small variances and high statistical confidence (P value). However, reports of highly significant P values are increasing even for contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses depending on the evolutionary model and inference method used, making it difficult to establish true relationships. We argue that the assessment of the robustness of results to biological factors, that may systematically mislead (bias) the outcomes of statistical estimation, will be a key to avoiding incorrect phylogenomic inferences. In fact, there is a need for increased emphasis on the magnitude of differences (effect sizes) in addition to the P values of the statistical test of the null hypothesis. On the other hand, the amount of sequence data available will likely always remain inadequate for some phylogenomic applications, for example, those involving episodic positive selection at individual codon positions and in specific lineages. Again, a focus on effect size and biological relevance, rather than the P value, may be warranted. Here, we present a theoretical overview and discuss practical aspects of the interplay between effect sizes, bias, and P values as it relates to the statistical inference of evolutionary truth in phylogenomics.},
  Comment                  = {On the different problems associated with the use of phylogenomics for several purposes. Reconstruction of species tree from phylogenomics data is hampered by the relative contribution of bias and variance (bias does not decrease with sample size while variance does, leading to very low p-values mainly driven by mismodelling). Furthermore, the use of phylogenomics in selection detection studies is limited by the availability of genomic data. Reconstruction is also limited for microbes where HGT accounts for a subsantial part of the genome and as few as 50 genes could contribute to the core genome of a species.},

  Abstract                 = {The comparative approach is routinely used to test for possible correlations between phenotypic or life-history traits. To correct for phylogenetic inertia, the method of independent contrasts assumes that continuous characters evolve along the phylogeny according to a multivariate Brownian process. Brownian diffusion processes have also been used to describe time variations of the parameters of the substitution process, such as the rate of substitution or the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework for testing the coupling between continuous characters and parameters of the molecular substitution process. Rates of substitution and continuous characters are jointly modeled as a multivariate Brownian diffusion process of unknown covariance matrix. The covariance matrix, the divergence times and the phylogenetic variations of substitution rates and continuous characters are all jointly estimated in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework, imposing on the covariance matrix a prior conjugate to the Brownian process so as to achieve a greater computational efficiency. The coupling between rates and phenotypes is assessed by measuring the posterior probability of positive or negative covariances, whereas divergence dates and phenotypic variations are marginally reconstructed in the context of the joint analysis. As an illustration, we apply the model to a set of 410 mammalian cytochrome b sequences. We observe a negative correlation between the rate of substitution and mass and longevity, which was previously observed. We also find a positive correlation between ω = dN/dS and mass and longevity, which we interpret as an indirect effect of variations of effective population size, thus in partial agreement with the nearly neutral theory. The method can easily be extended to any parameter of the substitution process and to any continuous phenotypic or environmental character.},

  Abstract                 = {A few duplicated genes have been found useful to root the universal tree of life. Despite controversial results, the consensus led to locate the root in the eubacterial branch. However, we demonstrated (Philippe and Forterre 1999) that all these markers were in fact unsuitable for any firm conclusion, mainly because of their high level of mutational saturation, which masks a major part of the phylogenetic signal. But then, the very persistence of signal for events as early as the separation of the three domains becomes puzzling. This paradox was studied here for translation elongation factor proteins, EF-1alpha and EF-2, which appeared to be one of the least confusing markers. We showed that these proteins do not conform to a classical rate-across-sites pattern, as those modeled by a gamma law, but rather to a covarion-based model, because the evolutionary rate of a given position often changes between taxonomic groups. Conservation of the very ancient signal can thus be better explained by the covarion model: a substitution can occur in deep branches, and the position remains constant afterward, as "fossilized" by a change of covation. As no reconstruction method has up to now taken into account this complex model, we devised a simple method for extracting the phylogenetic signal, by considering the variability of sequence positions within predefined phylogenetic groups. We showed that noise quantitatively prevailed upon signal. Parsimony will produce erroneous topologies, because it has to minimize primarily the number of steps of the noise. In contrast, our method effectively concentrated the signal and was more suitable for inferring ancient events. We consequently found the eubacterial rooting to be presumably due to a long branch attraction artifact, because of the higher evolutionary rate of Eubacteria for these proteins. Among the two other rooting possibilities, the eukaryotic rooting appeared to be more supported, although not enough to be conclusive.},

The critical issue is to quantify the uncertainty of the inference. The posterior probabilities in Bayesian phylogenetic inference and the bootstrap values in frequentist approaches measure the variability of the estimates due to the sampling of sites from genes and the sampling of genes from genomes. However, they do not measure the uncertainty due to taxon sampling. Taxa that experienced molecular homoplasy, recent selection, a spur of evolution, and so forth may disrupt the inference and cause incongruences in the estimated phylogeny. We define a taxon influence index to assess the influence of each taxon on the phylogeny. We found that although most taxa have a weak influence on the phylogeny, a small fraction of influential taxa strongly alter it even in clades only loosely related to them. We conclude that highly influential taxa should be given special attention and sampling them more thoroughly can lead to more dependable phylogenies.},

We argue that PCMs will continue to be a key set of tools in evolutionary biology, shedding new light on how evolutionary processes have shaped patterns of biodiversity through deep time.},
  Comment                  = {Nice source of references. An integrative view of the use of tree thinking in biology (with a focus on community ecology, quantitative genetics and paleobiology). PCM that directly model the evolution of traits on a phylogeny generally have superior statistical properties to their nonparametric counterparts. Sophisticated methods used in quantitative genetics for mixed models can now be used for comparative data (in the phylogenetic mixed model where a phylogeny takes the place of a pedigree). They allow study of models far more complex than the ones used up to date. Various question arise in the study of trait evoluton across a tree: what is a good model? Should saltational evolution be modeled with shifts in the rate of shifts in the mean? How to explore the data without a priori hypotheses? Should the trait be univariate or multivariate and perhaps the most difficult; should trait evolution be linked to the tree shape (if the trait has a impact on the diversification rate for example). Lineage diversification studies also show that phylogenies are generally more imblaced than expected from a birth-death models: this suggest that rates of speciation and extinction vary across clades on the tree of life. It is also crucial (albeit dificult) to study the impact of exctinction on tree shapes. Finally some models exists for the influence of character on diversification (the BiSSE method for example): not taking this dependency into contact may lead to serious inferrence errors. A major goal of PCM is to link microevolutionary and macroevolutionary scales. We know for example that wild selection is strong but that selection is usually slow at the macroevolutionary scale. Several authors related this to early/single/multiple burst models. Another view is that evolution model describe the dynamics of the adaptive landscape rather than the dynamics of a trait adapting to a static landscape. In particular, a variety of moves have been proposed for long term adaptation: drift, stasis on an adaptive peak, peak climbing and peak shifts models. Another array of research concerns community ecology but those are based on the essential assumption that at some level at least, a trait has some phylogenetic signal. Developing models that explicitly incorporate habitat filtering and competition in species assemblage is essential. The same is true for process that model species abundances along the branches of a tree.},

Phylogenetic signal is a measure of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal (due to the resulting high resemblance between related species). In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift, there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal. For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex. For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary process or rate based on estimates of phylogenetic signal.},
  Comment                  = {Phylogenetic signal = statistical nonindependence among species trait values due to their phylogenetic relatedness. Usually weak PS <- evolutionary lability and strong PS <- niche or evolutionary conservatism. The paper, by simulation study, shows that this is not true. PS is usually not correlated to evolutionary rate (\simeq mutation rate). PS for continous characters depends much more on the evolutionary process than on the evolution rate (not a good proxy of either of them). In fact, many processes lead to similar PS (notwithstanding the rate) and for the same process, depending on the conditions several PS can be obtained. No simple link between one and the other.

  Abstract                 = {The relative contribution of taxon number and gene number to accuracy in phylogenetic inference is a major issue in phylogenetics and of central importance to the choice of experimental strategies for the successful reconstruction of a broad sketch of the tree of life. Maximization of the number of taxa sampled is the strategy favored by most phylogeneticists, although its necessity remains the subject of debate. Vast increases in gene number are now possible due to advances in genomics, but large numbers of genes will be available for only modest numbers of taxa, raising the question of whether such genome-scale phylogenies will be robust to the addition of taxa. To examine the relative benefit of increasing taxon number or gene number to phylogenetic accuracy, we have developed an assay that utilizes the symmetric difference tree distance as a measure of phylogenetic accuracy. We have applied this assay to a genome-scale data matrix containing 106 genes from 14 yeast species. Our results show that increasing taxon number correlates with a slight decrease in phylogenetic accuracy. In contrast, increasing gene number has a significant positive effect on phylogenetic accuracy. Analyses of an additional taxon-rich data matrix from the same yeast clade show that taxon number does not have a significant effect on phylogenetic accuracy. The positive effect of gene number and the lack of effect of taxon number on phylogenetic accuracy are also corroborated by analyses of two data matrices from mammals and angiosperm plants, respectively. We conclude that, for typical data sets, the number of genes utilized may be a more important determinant of phylogenetic accuracy than taxon number.},

To systematically investigate the degree of incongruence, and potential methods for resolving it, we screened the genome sequences of eight yeast species and selected 106 widely distributed orthologous genes for phylogenetic analyses, singly and by concatenation. Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome. These results have important implications for resolving branches of the tree of life.},

In comparing tree topologies we concentrated on the position of the Gnetales, an important group whose placement has long been disputed. With either method, trees obtained from different taxon samples could be mutually contradictory and even disagree on groups that seemed strongly supported. Adding terminals improved the consistency of results for unweighted parsimony, but not for parsimony with third positions excluded and not for bayesian analysis, particularly when the general time-reversible model was employed. This suggests that attempting to resolve deep relationships using only a few taxa can lead to spurious conclusions, groupings unlikely to be repeatable with different taxon samplings or larger data sets. The effect of taxon sampling has not generally been recognized, and phylogenetic studies of seed plants have often been based on few taxa. Such insufficient sampling may help explain the variety of phylogenetic hypotheses for seed plants proposed in recent years. We recommend that restricted data sets such as single-gene subsets of multigene studies should be reanalyzed with alternative selections of terminals to assess topological consistency.},

In such cases, where there is a combination of short internal and long external branches, correctly estimating and rooting phylogenetic trees is known to be a difficult problem. In this simulation study, we tested the performances of different phylogenetic methods at estimating a tree that models a rapid radiation. We found that maximum likelihood, corrected and uncorrected neighbor-joining, and corrected and uncorrected parsimony, all suffer from biases toward specific tree topologies. In addition, we found that using a single-taxon outgroup to root a tree frequently disrupts an otherwise correct ingroup phylogeny. Moreover, for uncorrected parsimony, we found cases where several individual trees (in which the outgroup was placed incorrectly) were selected more frequently than the correct tree. Even for parameter settings where the correct tree was selected most frequently when using extremely long sequences, for sequences of up to 60,000 nucleotides the incorrectly rooted trees were each selected more frequently than the correct tree. For all the cases tested here, tree estimation using a two taxon outgroup was more accurate than when using a single-taxon outgroup. However, the ingroup was most accurately recovered when no outgroup was used.},

  Abstract                 = {Randomization routines have quickly gained wide usage in phylogenetic systematies. Introduced a decade ago, the jackknife has rarely been applied in cladistic methodology. This data resampling technique was re-investigated here as a means to discover the effect that taxon removal may have on the stability of the results obtained from parsimony analyses. This study shows that the removal of even a single taxon in an analysis can cause a solution of relatively few multiple equally parsimonious trees in an inclusive matrix to result in hundreds of equally parsimonious trees with the single removal of a taxon. On the other hand, removal of other taxa can stabilize the results to fewer trees. An index of clade stability, the Jackknife Monophyly Index (JMI) is developed which, like the bootstrap, applies a value to each clade according to its frequency of occurrence in jackknife pseudoreplicates. Unlike the bootstrap and earlier application of the jackknife, alternative suboptimal hypotheses are not forwarded by this method. Only those clades in the most parsimonious tree(s) are given JMI values. The behaviour of this index is investigated both in relation to a hypothetical and a real data set, as well as how it performs in comparison to the bootstrap. The JMI is found to not be influenced by uninformative characters or relative synapomorphy number, unlike the bootstrap.},

A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets > or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively. AVAILABILITY: icwww.epfl.ch/~stamatak},

  Abstract                 = {The most frequent measure of phylogenetic uncertainty for splits is bootstrap support. While large bootstrap support intuitively suggests that a split in a tree is well supported it has not been clear how large bootstrap support needs to be to conclude there is significant evidence that a hypothesized split is present. Indeed, recent work has shown that bootstrap support is not first-order correct and thus cannot be directly used for hypothesis testing. We present methods that adjust bootstrap support values in a maximum likelihood setting so that they have an interpretation corresponding to p-values in conventional hypothesis testing; for instance, adjusted bootstrap support larger than 95\% occurs only 5\% of the time if the split is not present. Through examples and simulation settings it is found that adjustments always increase the level of support. We also find that the nature of the adjustment is fairly constant across parameter settings. Finally, we consider adjustments that take into account the data-dependent nature of many hypotheses about splits: the hypothesis that they are present is being tested because they are in the tree estimated through maximum likelihood. Here, in contrast, we find that BP often needs be adjusted downwards.},

  Abstract                 = {Several authors have recently noted that when data are generated from a star topology, posterior probabilities can often be very large, even with arbitrarily large sequence lengths. This is counter to intuition, which suggests convergence to the limit of equal probability for each topology. Here the limiting distributions of bootstrap support and posterior probabilities are obtained for a four-taxon star tree. Theoretical results are given, providing confirmation that this counterintuitive phenomenon holds for both posterior probabilities and bootstrap support. For large samples the limiting results for posterior probabilities are the same regardless of the prior. With equal-length terminal edges, the limiting distribution is similar but not the same across different choices for the lengths of the edges. In contrast to previous results, the case of unequal lengths of terminal edges is considered. With two long edges, the posterior probability of the tree with long edges together tends to be much larger. Using the neighbor-joining algorithm, with equal edge lengths, the distribution of bootstrap support tends to be qualitatively comparable to posterior probabilities. As with posterior probabilities, when two of the edges are long, bootstrap support for the tree with long branches together tends to be large. The bias is less pronounced, however, as the distribution of bootstrap support gets close to uniform for this tree, whereas posterior probabilities are much more likely to be large. Our findings for maximum likelihood estimation are based entirely on simulation and in contrast suggest that bootstrap support tends to be fairly constant across edge-length choices.},
  Comment                  = {Distribution of BPP and BP for an unrooted four taxon tree. When the branch lengthes are equal, Laplace approximation used near the real value of the parameter allows to compute the exact distribution of the BPP. The limiting distribution has a limited variance so that the BPP has a >0 proba of being arbitrarily large. The same for the the limiting BP when using NJ. When the branch lengthes are not equal, BPP and BP gives significantly different results: BPP are skewed towards small values on the topo with long branches apart whereas BP are uniform. For the tree with long branches together, the result are comparable to same branch lengthes situation.},

  Abstract                 = {The star-tree paradox refers to the conjecture that the posterior probabilities for the three unrooted trees for four species (or the three rooted trees for three species if the molecular clock is assumed) do not approach 1/3 when the data are generated using the star tree and when the amount of data approaches infinity. It reflects the more general phenomenon of high and presumably spurious posterior probabilities for trees or clades produced by the Bayesian method of phylogenetic reconstruction, and it is perceived to be a manifestation of the deeper problem of the extreme sensitivity of Bayesian model selection to the prior on parameters. Analysis of the star-tree paradox has been hampered by the intractability of the integrals involved. In this article, I use Laplacian expansion to approximate the posterior probabilities for the three rooted trees for three species using binary characters evolving at a constant rate. The approximation enables calculation of posterior tree probabilities for arbitrarily large data sets. Both theoretical analysis of the analogous fair-coin and fair-balance problems and computer simulation for the tree problem confirmed the existence of the star-tree paradox. When the data size n --> infinity, the posterior tree probabilities do not converge to 1/3 each, but they vary among data sets according to a statistical distribution. This distribution is characterized. Two strategies for resolving the star-tree paradox are explored: (1) a nonzero prior probability for the degenerate star tree and (2) an increasingly informative prior forcing the internal branch length toward zero. Both appear to be effective in resolving the paradox, but the latter is simpler to implement. The posterior tree probabilities are found to be very sensitive to the prior.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved Bayesian method is presented for estimating phylogenetic trees using DNA sequence data. The birth-death process with species sampling is used to specify the prior distribution of phylogenies and ancestral speciation times, and the posterior probabilities of phylogenies are used to estimate the maximum posterior probability (MAP) tree. Monte Carlo integration is used to integrate over the ancestral speciation times for particular trees. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to generate the set of trees with the highest posterior probabilities. Methods are described for an empirical Bayesian analysis, in which estimates of the speciation and extinction rates are used in calculating the posterior probabilities, and a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, in which these parameters are removed from the model by an additional integration. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method avoids the requirement of our earlier method for calculating MAP trees to sum over all possible topologies (which limited the number of taxa in an analysis to about five). The methods are applied to analyze DNA sequences for nine species of primates, and the MAP tree, which is identical to a maximum-likelihood estimate of topology, has a probability of approximately 95\%.},

  Abstract                 = {The statistical properties of sample estimation and bootstrap estimation of phylogenetic variability from a sample of nucleotide sequences are studied by using model trees of three taxa with an outgroup and by assuming a constant rate of nucleotide substitution. The maximum-parsimony method of tree reconstruction is used. An analytic formula is derived for estimating the sequence length that is required if P, the probability of obtaining the true tree from the sampled sequences, is to be equal to or higher than a given value. Bootstrap estimation is formulated as a two-step sampling procedure: (1) sampling of sequences from the evolutionary process and (2) resampling of the original sequence sample. The probability that a bootstrap resampling of an original sequence sample will support the true tree is found to depend on the model tree, the sequence length, and the probability that a randomly chosen nucleotide site is an informative site. When a trifurcating tree is used as the model tree, the probability that one of the three bifurcating trees will appear in > or = 95\% of the bootstrap replicates is < 5\%, even if the number of bootstrap replicates is only 50; therefore, the probability of accepting an erroneous tree as the true tree is < 5\% if that tree appears in > or = 95\% of the bootstrap replicates and if more than 50 bootstrap replications are conducted. However, if a particular bifurcating tree is observed in, say, < 75\% of the bootstrap replicates, then it cannot be claimed to be better than the trifurcating tree even if > or = 1,000 bootstrap replications are conducted. When a bifurcating tree is used as the model tree, the bootstrap approach tends to overestimate P when the sequences are very short, but it tends to underestimate that probability when the sequences are long. Moreover, simulation results show that, if a tree is accepted as the true tree only if it has appeared in > or = 95\% of the bootstrap replicates, then the probability of failing to accept any bifurcating tree can be as large as 58\% even when P = 95\%, i.e., even when 95\% of the samples from the evolutionary process will support the true tree. Thus, if the rate-constancy assumption holds, bootstrapping is a conservative approach for estimating the reliability of an inferred phylogeny for four taxa.},
